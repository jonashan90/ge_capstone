# General Electric Wind Turbine Project

In the last decade, wind farms have become increasingly commonplace across the U.S. as society
has shifted its focus towards renewable energy and advancements in technology has enabled wind
turbines to be cost effective. The cost effectiveness of investing in wind farms largely depends on
the location of the turbines, as location greatly influences the amount of electricity generated over
time. A key factor in determining the location of a potential wind farm is the weather patterns of
that given location. Essentially, investors must be certain that a wind farm will produce enough
electricity over time to make their investment worthwhile. In this project, we will explore various
approaches to modelling the relationship between weather patterns and wind
turbine output given a specific location. Weather data was collected from Weather Underground
and a sample of on-shore turbine readings was provided to us by General Electric. We aligned these
two separate data sources using autocorrelation and cross-correlation and then we utilized vector
autoregression (VAR) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models to predict turbine output given
weather conditions.
